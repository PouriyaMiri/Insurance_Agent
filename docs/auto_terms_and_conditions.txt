1. Scope
This document describes standard terms for personal passenger vehicle insurance (private use). Commercial use, ride-hailing, and racing are excluded unless explicitly endorsed.

2. Coverage Levels (Simplified)
- Basic (Third-Party/Liability): covers damage or injury you cause to others, subject to policy limits.
- Standard: Basic + collision coverage for your vehicle (deductible applies).
- Premium: Standard + expanded assistance (e.g., towing limits) and optional replacement car (if included in schedule).

3. Policyholder Obligations
- Provide accurate and complete information (vehicle info, usage, location, modifications).
- Pay premiums on time.
- Take reasonable steps to prevent loss (e.g., locking vehicle, using correct tires).
- Notify the insurer promptly after an incident.

4. Claims Notification Timeframes (Guideline)
- Report incidents as soon as reasonably possible; ideally within 24 hours for accidents.
- Delayed reporting can affect claim handling if it materially prejudices investigation.

5. General Exclusions (High Level)
Coverage may be reduced or denied for: intentional acts, fraudulent statements, use under prohibited conditions, unlicensed driver, non-disclosed commercial use, and other exclusions listed in the exclusions document.

6. Deductibles
For coverages that include vehicle repair (collision/comprehensive), a deductible may apply. Deductible levels are selected at policy inception and shown on the schedule.

7. Dispute and Escalation
If the policyholder disputes a decision, the case can be escalated to a supervisor review and then to a formal complaints process.
