PREMIUM CALCULATION – METHODOLOGY & TERMS (INTERNAL PROTOTYPE)

Purpose
This document explains the premium estimate methodology used by the prototype quote assistant. The output is an estimate for demonstration and not a binding offer.

Inputs (prototype)
- Vehicle age (years)
- Engine power (horsepower; may be approximated from engine size)
- City (primary use location)
- Coverage level (basic, standard, premium)

Prototype Factors
1) Base rate: fixed starting value.
2) Vehicle age factor: increases slowly after a threshold year.
3) Power factor: increases above a threshold horsepower.
4) City factor: approximate risk adjustment by area.
5) Coverage factor: scales from basic to premium.

Terms & Conditions (prototype)
- Estimates can differ from final premium after underwriting.
- Missing or incorrect inputs can materially change estimates.
- Additional real-world factors not included: driver age, driving history, annual mileage, claims history, deductibles, vehicle value, theft risk by model, usage type, garaging, and discounts.

Compliance Note
This prototype is for internal testing and should present results as “estimate” with disclaimers. Final offers require policy schedule and regulatory-compliant pricing tables.
