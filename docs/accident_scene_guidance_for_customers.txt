ACCIDENT SCENE GUIDANCE (CUSTOMER-FACING SCRIPT, INTERNAL)

If an accident occurs:
1) Safety first: check for injuries, move to a safe place if possible.
2) Emergency services: call emergency services if there are injuries, hazards, or significant road blockage.
3) Exchange information: names, contacts, license plates, insurer details.
4) Evidence: take photos of vehicles, road conditions, and surrounding signage.
5) Witnesses: get contact details if available.
6) Police: follow local requirements; request a reference number if police attend.
7) Do not admit fault: exchange facts only.
8) Notify insurer: report promptly and keep receipts (towing, rental, urgent costs).

Goal: help customer remain calm, safe, and collect the minimum viable evidence.
